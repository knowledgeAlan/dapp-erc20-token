## What is ERC20 token ?

ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain. A fungible token is interchangeable with another tokenâ€”where the well-known non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not interchangeable.

ERC-20 allows developers to create smart-contract-enabled tokens that can be used with other products and services. These tokens are a representation of an asset, right, ownership, access, cryptocurrency, or anything else that is not unique in and of itself but can be transferred.
